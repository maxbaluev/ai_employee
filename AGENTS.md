# Agent Control Plane Playbook

**Status:** Updated October 6, 2025 Â· Control plane (FastAPI + Supabase integrations) is live Â· Multi-employee orchestration in progress

This file is the agent-facing control tower for the repository. Pair it with `README.md`
(human onboarding) and `docs/README.md` (documentation map) so code, docs, and
guardrails move together.

---

## Setup Commands
- `mise install` â€“ install pinned runtimes (Node 22, Python 3.13)
- `pnpm install` â€“ installs JS deps **and** runs `uv sync --extra test`
- `pnpm dev` â€“ runs Next.js UI (`dev:ui`) + agent (`dev:agent`) concurrently
- `pnpm run dev:agent` / `uv run python -m agent` â€“ FastAPI + ADK in isolation
- `pnpm run dev:ui` â€“ Next.js shell only (Turbopack)
- `pnpm lint` Â· `pnpm test` â€“ lint + contract/unit tests before any PR
- `pnpm build && pnpm start` â€“ production build smoke

## Code Style & Tooling
- **TypeScript**: strict mode (`tsconfig.json`); lint with Next.js config (`eslint.config.mjs`);
  Prettier defaults favour single quotes and trailing commas.
- **Python**: compose pure functions + pydantic models; keep guardrails side-effect free
  and covered by pytest (`tests/guardrails/`).
- Use `structlog` for agent logging; redact secrets before logging.
- Scripts under `scripts/` and `mise run` are uv-awareâ€”avoid invoking the interpreter directly.

## Testing Checklist
- `pnpm test` â€“ shared Jest/Vitest suites
- `pnpm lint` â€“ Next.js ESLint rules (strict)
- `uv run python -m pytest` â€“ targeted Python suites (`tests/`)
- `pnpm test --filter agent` â€“ run only agent-specific checks when needed
- Playwright smoke patterns live in `libs_docs/copilotkit_examples/tests`
- Re-run migrations after schema tweaks: `pnpm install:agent` â†’ `uv run python -m agent`

## Key Docs & Directories
- `docs/getting-started/core-concepts.md` â€“ end-to-end flow (UI â†” agent â†” Composio)
- `docs/architecture/*` â€“ component diagrams, data roadmap, frontend layout
- `docs/implementation/*` â€“ guardrails, callbacks, shared state, UI surfaces
- `docs/operations/*` â€“ deployment, observability, runbooks
- `docs/governance/*` â€“ security, approvals, doc ownership
- `docs/todo.md` â€“ layered backlog mirroring the phases below

## Current Implementation Snapshot
- `agent/app.py` exposes FastAPI via `ag_ui_adk.add_adk_fastapi_endpoint` for AGUI streams â†’ CopilotKit (`src/app/api/copilotkit/route.ts`).
- `agent/agents/control_plane.py` composes `google.adk.agents.LlmAgent`, desk blueprint, guardrails, Supabase-backed services, and Composio tooling (dependency injection keeps in-memory doubles viable).
- `agent/services/settings.py` (pydantic-settings) feeds guardrails, Composio, and Supabase configs with env parity across environments.
- In-memory fallbacks exist for catalog/objectives/outbox; Supabase implementations land in Phases 2 and 4.
- Worker skeleton (`worker/outbox.py`) and shared JSON schemas (`docs/schemas/*`) are committed.

## Multi-Phase Delivery Plan
Each phase references the authoritative items in `docs/todo.md`. Legend: âœ… done Â· ðŸ”„ in progress Â· ðŸ“‹ planned.

### Phase 0 Â· Foundation & Documentation Review âœ… (complete)
- Tooling bootstrap documented (`docs/getting-started/setup.md`).
- System overview synchronised (`docs/getting-started/core-concepts.md`, `docs/architecture/overview.md`).
- Supabase schema + seeds landed (`db/migrations/001_init.sql`, `db/seeds/000_demo_tenant.sql`).
- Shared-state schemas published (`docs/schemas/*`, `docs/implementation/frontend-shared-state.md`).
- Observability contracts defined (`docs/operations/run-and-observe.md`, `docs/references/observability.md`).

### Phase 1 Â· Control Plane Modularisation ðŸ”„
Goals: harden callbacks/guardrails/services and prep the multi-employee coordinator.
- [x] Guardrail modules with pytest coverage (`agent/guardrails/*`, `tests/guardrails/`).
- [x] Callback builders for before/after hooks (`agent/callbacks/before.py`, `agent/callbacks/after.py`).
- [x] Service abstractions with in-memory defaults (`agent/services/*.py`).
- [ ] Replace Proverbs demo diagram with modular blueprint (`docs/architecture/agent-control-plane.md`).
- [ ] Scaffold `agent/agents/coordinator.py` for multi-employee orchestration.
See `docs/implementation/backend-callbacks.md` and `docs/governance/security-and-guardrails.md`.

### Phase 2 Â· Composio Integration & Catalog ðŸ“‹
Goals: persist the tool catalog, manage OAuth, execute envelopes.
- [ ] Supabase-backed `CatalogService` replacing the shim (`agent/services/catalog.py`).
- [ ] Embed catalog â†’ envelope â†’ Outbox sequence diagram (`docs/architecture/composio-execution.md`).
- [ ] Wire Composio OAuth env vars + scope handling (`agent/services/settings.py`, `docs/implementation/composio-tooling.md`).
- [ ] Schedule nightly catalog sync with telemetry (Supabase Cron + Edge Functions + Tenacity for retries).
Depends on Phase 1 service boundaries.

### Phase 3 Â· Approvals & Frontend State ðŸ“‹
Goals: schema-driven approval surfaces with CopilotKit parity.
- [ ] Document Desk/Approvals layout & state contracts (`docs/architecture/frontend.md`).
- [ ] Scaffold approval forms from JSON Schema (`docs/implementation/ui-surfaces.md`, `docs/schemas/approval-modal.json`).
- [ ] Emit `StateDeltaEvent`s for all agent mutations (`agent/callbacks/after.py`).
- [ ] Add Playwright coverage for sidebar boot, desk render, approval submit/cancel, guardrail banner (`libs_docs/copilotkit_examples/tests`).
Requires Phase 2 catalog persistence for schema hydration.

### Phase 4 Â· Data Persistence & Outbox Worker ðŸ”„
Goals: replace in-memory services with Supabase + ship the Outbox executor.
- [x] Baseline migrations + seeds committed (`db/migrations/001_init.sql`, `db/seeds/000_demo_tenant.sql`).
- [ ] Implement Supabase-backed Outbox service + retry semantics (`agent/services/outbox.py`, `worker/outbox.py`).
- [ ] Document DLQ replay flow end-to-end (`docs/operations/runbooks/outbox-recovery.md`).
- [ ] Add ERD + migration conventions (`docs/architecture/data-roadmap.md`).
Depends on Phase 2 envelope contracts.

### Phase 5 Â· Observability & Operations ðŸ“‹
Goals: production telemetry, alerts, and runbooks.
- [ ] Expose `/metrics` FastAPI route + integrate collectors (`docs/operations/run-and-observe.md`).
- [ ] Fill observability dashboard placeholders with PromQL queries (`docs/references/observability.md`).
- [ ] Expand incident runbooks with real postmortems + comms templates (`docs/operations/runbooks/`).
Requires Phase 4 worker telemetry to be emitting.

### Phase 6 Â· Governance & Documentation Hygiene âœ… (ongoing)
Goals: keep docs evergreen and guardrails enforced.
- [x] Doc ownership matrix + audit cadence defined (`docs/governance/ownership-and-evergreen.md`).
- [x] Guardrail PR checklist published (`docs/governance/security-and-guardrails.md`).
- [ ] Extend CONTRIBUTING/PR templates with TODO references once those files exist.
Runs alongside every phase; audit quarterly.

## Operational Guardrails & Safety
- Guardrail modules stay pure; inject via `before_model`/`after_model` callbacks. Cover quiet hours, trust, scopes, evidence requirements.
- Approval flows emit structured audit events + shared-state deltas (`docs/implementation/frontend-shared-state.md`).
- Use `structlog` for tenant + envelope logging; scrub secrets; persist audit breadcrumbs in Supabase.
- Short-circuit demo runs with `callback_context.end_invocation = True` (per ADK quickstarts).

## Handy References
- `docs/todo.md` â€“ single source of remaining work mapped to the phases above.
- `libs_docs/adk/full_llm_docs.txt` â€“ callback + multi-agent patterns.
- `libs_docs/composio_next/python/providers/google_adk/google_adk_demo.py` â€“ Composio tool bridging reference.
- `libs_docs/copilotkit_docs/adk/` â€“ shared state + human-in-the-loop flows for UI parity.

Keep this playbook current: update it whenever behaviour changes ship or documentation status flips.
