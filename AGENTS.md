# Agent Control Plane Playbook

**Status:** Updated October 6, 2025 · Control plane (FastAPI + Supabase integrations) is live · Multi-employee orchestration in progress

This file is the agent-facing control tower for the repository. Pair it with `README.md`
(human onboarding) and `docs/README.md` (documentation map) so code, docs, and
guardrails move together.

---

## Setup Commands
- `mise install` – install pinned runtimes (Node 22, Python 3.13)
- `pnpm install` – installs JS deps **and** runs `uv sync --extra test`
- `pnpm dev` – runs Next.js UI (`dev:ui`) + agent (`dev:agent`) concurrently
- `pnpm run dev:agent` / `uv run python -m agent` – FastAPI + ADK in isolation
- `pnpm run dev:ui` – Next.js shell only (Turbopack)
- `pnpm lint` · `pnpm test` – lint + contract/unit tests before any PR
- `pnpm build && pnpm start` – production build smoke

## Code Style & Tooling
- **TypeScript**: strict mode (`tsconfig.json`); lint with Next.js config (`eslint.config.mjs`);
  Prettier defaults favour single quotes and trailing commas.
- **Python**: compose pure functions + pydantic models; keep guardrails side-effect free
  and covered by pytest (`tests/guardrails/`).
- Use `structlog` for agent logging; redact secrets before logging.
- Scripts under `scripts/` and `mise run` are uv-aware—avoid invoking the interpreter directly.

## Testing Checklist
- `pnpm test` – shared Jest/Vitest suites
- `pnpm lint` – Next.js ESLint rules (strict)
- `uv run python -m pytest` – targeted Python suites (`tests/`)
- `pnpm test --filter agent` – run only agent-specific checks when needed
- Playwright smoke patterns live in `libs_docs/copilotkit_examples/tests`
- Re-run migrations after schema tweaks: `pnpm install:agent` → `uv run python -m agent`

## Key Docs & Directories
- `docs/getting-started/core-concepts.md` – end-to-end flow (UI ↔ agent ↔ Composio)
- `docs/architecture/*` – component diagrams, data roadmap, frontend layout
- `docs/implementation/*` – guardrails, callbacks, shared state, UI surfaces
- `docs/operations/*` – deployment, observability, runbooks
- `docs/governance/*` – security, approvals, doc ownership
- `docs/todo.md` – layered backlog mirroring the phases below

## Current Implementation Snapshot
- `agent/app.py` exposes FastAPI via `ag_ui_adk.add_adk_fastapi_endpoint` for AGUI streams → CopilotKit (`src/app/api/copilotkit/route.ts`).
- `agent/agents/control_plane.py` composes `google.adk.agents.LlmAgent`, desk blueprint, guardrails, Supabase-backed services, and Composio tooling (dependency injection keeps in-memory doubles viable).
- `agent/services/settings.py` (pydantic-settings) feeds guardrails, Composio, and Supabase configs with env parity across environments.
- In-memory fallbacks exist for catalog/objectives/outbox; Supabase implementations land in Phases 2 and 4.
- Worker skeleton (`worker/outbox.py`) and shared JSON schemas (`docs/schemas/*`) are committed.

## Multi-Phase Delivery Plan
Each phase references the authoritative items in `docs/todo.md`. Legend: ✅ done · 🔄 in progress · 📋 planned.

### Phase 0 · Foundation & Documentation Review ✅ (complete)
- Tooling bootstrap documented (`docs/getting-started/setup.md`).
- System overview synchronised (`docs/getting-started/core-concepts.md`, `docs/architecture/overview.md`).
- Supabase schema + seeds landed (`db/migrations/001_init.sql`, `db/seeds/000_demo_tenant.sql`).
- Shared-state schemas published (`docs/schemas/*`, `docs/implementation/frontend-shared-state.md`).
- Observability contracts defined (`docs/operations/run-and-observe.md`, `docs/references/observability.md`).

### Phase 1 · Control Plane Modularisation 🔄

**Goal** Harden callback + guardrail orchestration and service boundaries so the desk blueprint stays stable while we layer in multi-employee coordination.

**Baseline**
- Guardrail modules (`agent/guardrails/*.py`) are wired through `agent/callbacks/guardrails.py` and exercised in `tests/guardrails/`; each exposes a pure `check(...) -> GuardrailResult` consumed by `build_before_model_modifier` so refusals short-circuit safely.
- Callback builders in `agent/callbacks/before.py` and `agent/callbacks/after.py` own prompt enrichment, shared-state seeding, envelope enqueueing, and deterministic use of `callback_context.end_invocation` as outlined in `docs/implementation/backend-callbacks.md`.
- Service shims in `agent/services/catalog.py`, `agent/services/objectives.py`, `agent/services/outbox.py`, and `agent/services/audit.py` mirror the Supabase contracts documented in `docs/architecture/agent-control-plane.md`, keeping tests and local runs Supabase-free.

**In Flight**
- Replace the remaining Proverbs-era diagram with the modular blueprint now captured in `docs/architecture/agent-control-plane.md` so reviewers see the same component map referenced here and in `docs/todo.md`.
- Scaffold `agent/agents/coordinator.py` to compose shared services and callbacks for multi-employee orchestration without duplicating desk-specific wiring; follow the “Target Package Layout” guidance before introducing Supabase persistence.

**Guardrails**
- Adhere to the matrix in `docs/governance/security-and-guardrails.md`: log every guardrail decision via `StructlogAuditLogger`, reuse the refusal tone guide, and block runs by setting `callback_context.end_invocation = True`.
- New guardrails land as pure modules registered through `agent/callbacks/guardrails.py`, paired with pytest coverage in `tests/guardrails/` to keep the enforcement layer deterministic and dependency-injected.

### Phase 2 · Composio Integration & Catalog 📋
Goals: persist the tool catalog, manage OAuth, execute envelopes.
- [ ] Supabase-backed `CatalogService` replacing the shim (`agent/services/catalog.py`).
- [ ] Embed catalog → envelope → Outbox sequence diagram (`docs/architecture/composio-execution.md`).
- [ ] Wire Composio OAuth env vars + scope handling (`agent/services/settings.py`, `docs/implementation/composio-tooling.md`).
- [ ] Schedule nightly catalog sync with telemetry (Supabase Cron + Edge Functions + Tenacity for retries).
Depends on Phase 1 service boundaries.

### Phase 3 · Approvals & Frontend State 📋
Goals: schema-driven approval surfaces with CopilotKit parity.
- [ ] Document Desk/Approvals layout & state contracts (`docs/architecture/frontend.md`).
- [ ] Scaffold approval forms from JSON Schema (`docs/implementation/ui-surfaces.md`, `docs/schemas/approval-modal.json`).
- [ ] Emit `StateDeltaEvent`s for all agent mutations (`agent/callbacks/after.py`).
- [ ] Add Playwright coverage for sidebar boot, desk render, approval submit/cancel, guardrail banner (`libs_docs/copilotkit_examples/tests`).
Requires Phase 2 catalog persistence for schema hydration.

### Phase 4 · Data Persistence & Outbox Worker 🔄
Goals: replace in-memory services with Supabase + ship the Outbox executor.
- [x] Baseline migrations + seeds committed (`db/migrations/001_init.sql`, `db/seeds/000_demo_tenant.sql`).
- [ ] Implement Supabase-backed Outbox service + retry semantics (`agent/services/outbox.py`, `worker/outbox.py`).
- [ ] Document DLQ replay flow end-to-end (`docs/operations/runbooks/outbox-recovery.md`).
- [ ] Add ERD + migration conventions (`docs/architecture/data-roadmap.md`).
Depends on Phase 2 envelope contracts.

### Phase 5 · Observability & Operations 📋
Goals: production telemetry, alerts, and runbooks.
- [ ] Expose `/metrics` FastAPI route + integrate collectors (`docs/operations/run-and-observe.md`).
- [ ] Fill observability dashboard placeholders with PromQL queries (`docs/references/observability.md`).
- [x] Expand incident runbooks with real postmortems + comms templates (`docs/operations/runbooks/`).
Requires Phase 4 worker telemetry to be emitting.

### Phase 6 · Governance & Documentation Hygiene ✅ (ongoing)
Goals: keep docs evergreen and guardrails enforced.
- [x] Doc ownership matrix + audit cadence defined (`docs/governance/ownership-and-evergreen.md`).
- [x] Guardrail PR checklist published (`docs/governance/security-and-guardrails.md`).
- [ ] Extend CONTRIBUTING/PR templates with TODO references once those files exist.
Runs alongside every phase; audit quarterly.

## Operational Guardrails & Safety
- Guardrail modules stay pure; inject via `before_model`/`after_model` callbacks. Cover quiet hours, trust, scopes, evidence requirements.
- Approval flows emit structured audit events + shared-state deltas (`docs/implementation/frontend-shared-state.md`).
- Use `structlog` for tenant + envelope logging; scrub secrets; persist audit breadcrumbs in Supabase.
- Short-circuit demo runs with `callback_context.end_invocation = True` (per ADK quickstarts).

## Handy References
- `docs/todo.md` – single source of remaining work mapped to the phases above.
- `libs_docs/adk/full_llm_docs.txt` – callback + multi-agent patterns.
- `libs_docs/composio_next/python/providers/google_adk/google_adk_demo.py` – Composio tool bridging reference.
- `libs_docs/copilotkit_docs/adk/` – shared state + human-in-the-loop flows for UI parity.

Keep this playbook current: update it whenever behaviour changes ship or documentation status flips.
